            Virtualization is technology that lets you create useful IT services using resources that are
            traditionally bound to hardware. It allows you to use a physical machine’s full capacity by distributing
            its capabilities among many users or environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Software called hypervisors separate the physical resources from the virtual environments—the things
            that need those resources. Hypervisors can sit on top of an operating system (like on a laptop) or be
            installed directly onto hardware (like a server), which is how most enterprises virtualize. Hypervisors
            take your physical resources and divide them up so that virtual environments can use them.

        <p>
            Containerization has become a major trend in software development as an alternative or companion to
            virtualization. It involves encapsulating or packaging up software code and all its dependencies so that
            it can run uniformly and consistently on any infrastructure. The technology is quickly maturing,
            resulting in measurable benefits for developers and operations teams as well as overall software
            infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Containerization allows developers to create and deploy applications faster and more securely. With
            traditional methods, code is developed in a specific computing environment which, when transferred to a
            new location, often results in bugs and errors. For example, when a developer transfers code from a
            desktop computer to a virtual machine (VM) or from a Linux to a Windows operating system.
            Containerization eliminates this problem by bundling the application code together with the related
            configuration files, libraries, and dependencies required for it to run. This single package of software
            or “container” is abstracted away from the host operating system, and hence, it stands alone and becomes
            portable—able to run across any platform or cloud, free of issues.
        </p>

        <img src="./images/pic_comparison.jpg" alt="comparison" class="img-fluid">
        <p>
            In traditional virtualization, a hypervisor virtualizes physical hardware. The result is that each
            virtual machine contains a guest OS, a virtual copy of the hardware that the OS requires to run, and an
            application and its associated libraries and dependencies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead of virtualizing the underlying hardware, containers virtualize the operating system (typically
            Linux) so each individual container contains only the application and its libraries and dependencies.
            Containers are small, fast, and portable because unlike a virtual machine, containers do not need to
            include a guest OS in every instance and can, instead, simply leverage the features and resources of the
            host OS.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just like virtual machines, containers allow developers to improve CPU and memory utilization of
            physical machines. Containers go even further, however, because they also enable microservice
            architectures, where application components can be deployed and scaled more granularly. This is an
            attractive alternative to having to scale up an entire monolithic application because a single component
            is struggling with load.
